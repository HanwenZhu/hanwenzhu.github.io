Traveling to the moon only started relatively recently, and has become a fashion thanks to the cold war. Despite this global trend, only a surprisingly low number of earthly beings have had the chance to reach it, and among those earthly beings, only 12 happened to be humans, all coincidentally in the Apollo missions.

### Pack
Depending on your disposition, you may want to bring your own oxygen and/or water. Unlike the gas-protected rotating Earth, the surface of the moon can get pretty hot or cold with each day or night spanning 15 Earth days. For this reason, plus the radiation, you might also wish to put on a spacesuit.

If water along cannot satisfy your nutritional necessities, you can also consider buying some freezed and dried high-carbonhydrate or high-protein food before you go.

Don't bring too much personal items though, because space travels can get pretty expensive for anything you bring that draws gravity.

### Get on
There are different ways to get onto the moon, but most popular choices include a rocket entering Earth orbit, leaving it, and entering moon orbit. You can choose to stay in moon orbit, or you can send a lander down to the moon and back up. Getting back to Earth is similar.

Space stations orbiting Earth can be useful stops to refuel or resupply your spacecraft. This has not been tried before, because nobody has been to the moon since space stations were put up, but they're pretty good choices. You can also wait for moon-orbiting space stations to be built.

### Get around
Most people use a rover to get around the moon for long distances, although you can also stroll around by foot. Although simplistic and uncomfortable, traveling by rover is a traditional culture on the moon.

Be cautious if you travel to the far side of the moon, especially if you don't have an accompanying spacecraft to facilitate communication with Earth.

It is recommended to check out the daylight cycle and different seas before you plan your route. Some places can get pretty dark or rocky.

### See
##### Landscape
Make sure to check out the extensive set of waterless water features, encompassing *maria* (seas), *oceanus* (oceans), *lacus* (lakes), *sinus* (bays), *paludes* (marshes), etc. They are usually less rocky and more comfy for arrival, departure, and living. It is hard to imagine how fascinating it is to stroll in the Sinus Amoris of Mare Tranquillitatis, or the Bay of Love of Sea of Tranquility.

##### Earthrise
Earthrise is relatively uncommon on the moon. But if you're traveling through the edge between the near and far sides of the moon, be sure to enjoy the Earthrise and Earthset that happen every Earth month because the moon is eccentric and unparallel. What is possibly more romantic than a walk in an Earthlit night, as the mostly harmless planet rises above the horizon?
