title: On creating this website
description: And other thoughts
---

I am a very bored grade 11 student who is loaded by pressure from high school curricula and college application. This blog is created primarily for my own pleasure and, despite having Google Analytics tracking the number of visitors, I don't care as much if people read the posts.

I plan to post stuff on math or computer science and other unrelated stuff. Contents posted will be copyright me, but feel free to use it for whatever purpose with proper attribution.
