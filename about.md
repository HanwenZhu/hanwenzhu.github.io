This is a website mainly established to have my own domain name. I will post random posts onto this website.

Sometimes I feel like writing a lot, and I consequently write a lot. Sometimes I feel like usual, so I shrug at the unpublished drafts and put and delete some words here and there. Sometimes I feel tired, so the keyboard merrily sits untouched (which is most of the time).
